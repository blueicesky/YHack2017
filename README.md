# YHack2017
We built a Machine learning Vision app that will help you pre-diagnose any serious illnesses or diseases based on the signs on your face, and using facial keypoint detection, to calculate your risk of stroke.

The entire frontend is built in iOS with Swift and Objective-C
The entire backend is hosted on the Google Compute Engine and written in Python
The machine learning is done using Tensorflow and Keras. We also used Google Vision API for Facial keypoint detection.
